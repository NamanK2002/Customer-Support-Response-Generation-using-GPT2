# Customer Support Response Generation

## Objective
Build a model to generate automated responses to customer queries.

## Dataset
[Customer Support Responses](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kaludi/Customer-Support-Responses)

## Tasks
1. Explore and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model or use a transformer-based model like GPT-3 for generating responses.
3. Fine-tune the model for coherence and relevance.
4. Evaluate the generated responses for quality and appropriateness.

## Deliverables
1. Code and documentation.
2. Response generation model.
3. A demo where users can input a query and receive an automated response (implemented in a Jupyter notebook).

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Download and place the dataset in the `data/` folder.
4. Run the data preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python scripts/preprocess_data.py
    ```
5. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python scripts/train_model.py
    ```
6. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python scripts/evaluate_model.py
    ```
7. Use the demo notebook (`notebooks/demo.ipynb`) to interact with the model.
