# Customer Support Response Generation

## Objective
Build a model to generate automated responses to customer queries.

## Dataset
[Customer Support Responses](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kaludi/Customer-Support-Responses)

## Tasks
1. Explore and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model or use a transformer-based model like GPT-3 for generating responses.
3. Fine-tune the model for coherence and relevance.
4. Evaluate the generated responses for quality and appropriateness.

## Deliverables
1. Code and documentation.
2. Response generation model.
3. A demo where users can input a query and receive an automated response (implemented in a Jupyter notebook).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git 
cd your-repository
```


2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

>>Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

>>MacOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the Dataset

Download the dataset from Hugging Face and place it in the data/ directory. Rename it to customer_support_responses.csv.

5. Preprocess the Data

Prepare the dataset for training by running the preprocessing script.

```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
```

6. Train the Model

Train the Seq2Seq model with the preprocessed data.

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

7. Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script.

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
```

## Jupyter Notebooks ##

The project includes the following Jupyter notebooks for exploration, training, and demonstration:

data_exploration.ipynb: Explore and visualize the dataset to understand its structure and content.
model_training.ipynb: Train and evaluate the Seq2Seq model. Includes model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
demo.ipynb: Interactive notebook for testing the model. Users can input a query and receive a generated response.

To use the notebooks:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the Notebooks

Navigate to the notebooks/ directory in the Jupyter interface and open the desired notebook.

>> # Usage
Data Exploration: Utilize data_exploration.ipynb to gain insights into the dataset and visualize key metrics.
Model Training: Use model_training.ipynb to train the model, adjust hyperparameters, and evaluate performance.
Interactive Demo: Run demo.ipynb to interact with the trained model and test response generation.
